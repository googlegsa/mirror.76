Documill End-User Licence Agreement (EULA)

Date: 1/1/2008

This Documill End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement
between the licensee ("LICENSEE", either an individual or a single
entity) and Documill for the materials accompanying this EULA, which
may include computer software, associated media, printed materials,
and on-line or electronic documentation and source files, resource
files, project and solution files including source code for software,
collectively defined as "SOFTWARE".

The accompanying SOFTWARE is licensed to the LICENSEE only upon the
condition that the LICENSEE accepts all of these license terms. By
installing or using the accompanying SOFTWARE the LICENSEE agrees that
it has read these terms and agrees to be bound by them. If the
LICENSEE does not agree to all of these terms, it should not download,
install, use or copy the SOFTWARE. The SOFTWARE is protected by
copyright laws and international copyright treamties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is licensed, not
sold to the LICENSEE.


LICENSE

These Documill License Terms cover any and all Documill applications,
SDKs or other computer programs including related documentation
(together the "Software") licensed by the Licensee ("LICENSEE")
available for customers who choose to purchase Documill software and
services.

The Software is licensed, not sold, to LICENSEE for use only under the
following terms. Documill reserves any and all rights not expressly
granted to LICENSEE. Documill retains ownership of all copies of the
Software and released updates and upgrades to the Software. For those
customers who choose to purchase Documill software, Documill provides
the Software only in electronic format.


SOFTWARE LICENSE GRANT

Documill grants the use of the SOFTWARE and it's licensed components
according to one of the license types below as identified in the
Documill License Certificate (DLC). DLC also lists LICENSEE specific
restrictions like number of CPUs, number of developers, name of the
LICENSEE application or service.

[i] Evaluation License. An Evaluation license grants a non-exclusive
right to use the SOFTWARE for evaluation use only. The SOFTWARE with
an evaluation license is fully functional except the functionality of
the SOFTWARE is limited by time. When using an evaluation license the
SOFTWARE is strictly prohibited from being used in the production of
any software or service. Any violation of this provision shall require
a mandatory purchase of an appropriate license as well as expose the
LICENSEE to other possible legal recourse for collection and punitive
damages. If the LICENSEE does not agree to the terms, it should not
evaluate this component and remove it from its computer systems
immediately.

[ii] Developer License. A Developer license grants one or more
developers to use the SOFTWARE for creating applications using the
appropriately licensed distribution version of the SOFTWARE license. A
Developer license must be purchased for each developer utilizing the
SOFTWARE. Depending on case-by-case agreed commercial terms, a
Developer license may be granted per development site (physical
location), and thus enable unlimited number of developers to work with
the SOFTWARE in that specifically defined development site.

[iii] Server License. A Server license grants the LICENSEE to install
and use the SOFTWARE for internal use only within the pre-defined
limitations written as max number of CPUs the server system running
the SOFTWARE may utilize to run the SOFTWARE. Typically, Server
license is the default production license for the SOFTWARE, and it
scales up based on the number of CPUs. In case of runtime environments
supporting server virtualization, the Server License is tied to the
specific virtualized server instance besides the number of CPUs
allocated to support that virtualized server instance.

[iv] ASP License. An ASP license grants the LICENSEE to use the
SOFTWARE to produce a named service for unlimited number of
end-users. The ASP license grants the LICENSEE to install the SOFTWARE
within the pre-defined limitations, like number of server CPUs,
written to the Documill License Certificate. Typically an ASP License
is required if the SOFTWARE is used in an application/service running
on a server which is operating on the Internet or an Extranet made
available to the customers of the LICENSEE.

[v] OEM License. An OEM license grants the LICENSEE to create a named
licensee application utilizing the SOFTWARE. An OEM license allows the
LICENSEE to distribute the named licensee application utilizing the
SOFTWARE within the pre-defined limitations written to the Documill
License Certificate.

All Documill software licensees are non-transferable and non-exclusive,
and grant the LICENSEE rights to evaluate, use and/or distribute the
SOFTWARE, depending on the license type specific definitions and
limitations.

shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the
